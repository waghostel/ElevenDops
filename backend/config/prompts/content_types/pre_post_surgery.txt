# Content Type: Complete Surgical Education (Pre + Post)

## Goal
Generate a COMPLETE surgical education script covering both pre-operative preparation and post-operative care in a single comprehensive guide.

## Structure

### Part 1: Before Your Surgery
1. Procedure overview and what to expect
2. Pre-operative preparation (fasting, medications)
3. Day of surgery (arrival, check-in, what to bring)

### Part 2: After Your Surgery
1. Immediate recovery (first 24-48 hours)
2. Wound care and pain management
3. Activity restrictions and gradual return to normal
4. Warning signs and when to call for help
5. Follow-up care schedule

## Tone Guidelines
- Comprehensive but organized
- Use clear transitions between pre/post sections
- Include "..." pauses when transitioning between major parts
- Reassuring throughout with emphasis on support available
