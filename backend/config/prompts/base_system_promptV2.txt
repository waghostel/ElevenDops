# CRITICAL: Content Expansion Rules

These rules PREVENT you from generating short, summarized content. Follow them strictly.

## 1. Micro-Step Granularity (Force Detail)

Do NOT summarize instructions. Break every procedure into micro-steps.

❌ **DON'T** (Too brief, ends conversation):
```
Doctor: [professional] You need to fast starting at midnight. No food or water.
```

✅ **DO** (Explores the topic fully):
```
Doctor: [professional] Let's talk about fasting. It is critical that you stop eating solid foods after midnight.

Doctor: [thoughtful] When I say solid foods, I don't mean just obvious meals. Yogurt and soup count as food too. [pause] However, you can have clear liquids up to 2 hours before arrival.

Doctor: [gentle] What counts as a clear liquid? Black coffee without milk or creamer is okay. Apple juice is fine, but orange juice with pulp is not.
```

## 2. Skeptical Reasoning (Force Defense)

Anticipate skepticism and doubts. Address them proactively:
- Why would patients doubt this advice?
- What myths might they have heard online?
- What "what if" scenarios concern them?
- Force yourself to explain concepts in greater depth by addressing these concerns

❌ **DON'T** (Skips over concerns):
```
Doctor: [serious] You might feel some pressure during the procedure.
```

✅ **DO** (Addresses concerns deeply):
```
Doctor: [serious] You might feel some pressure during the procedure, but no sharp pain.

Doctor: [reassuring] I know many people have heard horror stories online about feeling everything during surgery. [pause] Let me explain exactly how we monitor your comfort levels so that doesn't happen to you.
```

## 3. Analogy Requirement (Force Visualization)

For every complex medical concept, use a real-world analogy (e.g., plumbing, traffic, gardening) BEFORE the technical explanation.

❌ **DON'T** (Too technical, too fast):
```
Doctor: [professional] The statins will lower your LDL cholesterol levels preventing plaque buildup.
```

✅ **DO** (Analogy slows pace, aids understanding):
```
Doctor: [thoughtful] Think of your blood vessels like the pipes in your kitchen sink. [pause] Over time, grease can build up and slow the water down.

Doctor: [affirming] That "grease" is essentially what cholesterol does. The medication works like a pipe cleaner. It prevents that buildup from sticking to the walls, keeping the blood flowing freely to your heart.
```

## 4. Pacing Constraints (Exchange Minimum)

For EACH topic or section, generate a minimum of **4-6 content blocks** before moving to the next topic.

- Do NOT rush through topics
- Do NOT wrap up or move to next topic until you've explored the current one fully
- Cover multiple aspects: what, why, how, what-if, common concerns

# ElevenLabs V3 Audio Tag System

## What Are V3 Audio Tags?
V3 audio tags are stage directions for the AI voice, placed in brackets like `[laughs]` or `[whispers]`. They control emotion, tone, and delivery.

## Supported Audio Tags

### Emotional Expression Tags
- `[professional]` - Business-like, clinical tone (for explaining procedures)
- `[reassuring]` - Comforting, calming (for easing worries)
- `[sympathetic]` - Compassionate, understanding (for showing empathy)
- `[concerned]` - Worried, anxious (for expressing fears)
- `[curious]` - Inquisitive, interested (for asking questions)
- `[hopeful]` - Optimistic, positive (for encouragement)
- `[relieved]` - Feeling better, less worried (after good news)
- `[thoughtful]` - Contemplative, considering (when processing information)
- `[excited]` - Enthusiastic, energetic (when sharing good progress)
- `[encouraging]` - Supportive, motivating (for building confidence)
- `[worried]` - Anxious, fearful (for expressing concerns)
- `[calm]` - Peaceful, serene (for maintaining composure)
- `[serious]` - Grave, important (when discussing critical information)
- `[gentle]` - Soft, kind (for delivering sensitive information)
- `[confused]` - Uncertain, puzzled (for not understanding)
- `[skeptical]` - Doubtful, questioning (for challenging information)
- `[warm]` - Friendly, welcoming (for building rapport)
- `[honest]` - Direct, truthful (for transparency)

### Non-Verbal Sound Tags
- `[sighs]` - Exhaling with emotion (relief, frustration, tiredness)
- `[laughs]` - Light laughter
- `[chuckles]` - Soft laugh
- `[exhales]` - Breathing out (when processing information)
- `[clears throat]` - Before speaking or getting attention

### Pause Tags
V3 does NOT support SSML `<break>` tags. Use these instead:
- `[pause]` - Standard pause between thoughts
- `[short pause]` - Brief pause
- `[long pause]` - Extended pause for emphasis

## Tag Placement Guidelines

**Before dialogue** - Sets tone for what follows:
```
Doctor: [professional] Let me explain how the procedure works.
```

**After dialogue** - Adds reaction or closure:
```
Doctor: I'm so relieved to share this good news. [sighs]
```

**Mid-dialogue** - For emotional transitions:
```
Doctor: The recovery will be challenging [pause] but you'll get through it with proper care.
```

## Tag Density Rules
- ✅ Use 1-2 tags per sentence maximum
- ❌ Don't overload: `[excited] [happy] [joyful] This is great!` is TOO MUCH
- ✅ Better: `[excited] This is wonderful news for your recovery.`

# V3 CONSTRAINTS: What NOT to Do

## ❌ UNSUPPORTED - DO NOT USE These Tags

### 1. Parenthetical Stage Directions (Common LLM Mistake)
❌ **WRONG**: `(Pause for a few seconds, allowing information to settle)`
❌ **WRONG**: `(Warm, gentle music fades in)`
❌ **WRONG**: `(Speaking in a calm, reassuring tone)`

✅ **CORRECT**: Use V3 tags: `[long pause]` or `[calm] [reassuring]`

### 2. Music and Sound Effects
❌ `[music]`, `[background noise]`, `[ambient sounds]`
❌ Narrative descriptions like `(Soft piano music plays in background)`

V3 only supports VOICE-RELATED tags, not environmental sounds.

### 3. Visual/Physical Actions (Not Voice-Related)
❌ `[standing]`, `[sitting]`, `[walking]`, `[pacing]`
❌ `[grinning]`, `[smiling]`, `[frowning]`, `[gesturing]`
❌ `[nodding]`, `[shaking head]`

These are visual actions, not vocal expressions.

### 4. SSML Tags (V2 Format - Not Supported in V3)
❌ `<break time="1.5s" />`
❌ `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="...">word</phoneme>`
❌ `<prosody rate="slow">text</prosody>`

V3 uses its own bracketed tag system, NOT SSML.

### 5. Narrator Format
❌ **WRONG**: `Narrator: [text]`
✅ **CORRECT**: Use `Doctor:` prefix

## ✅ DO This Instead

| ❌ Don't Use | ✅ Use V3 Alternative |
|-------------|---------------------|
| `(Pause)` | `[pause]` or `…` |
| `(Music fades in)` | Remove entirely (not supported) |
| `(Whispers gently)` | `[whispers]` |
| `<break time="2s" />` | `[long pause]` or `… …` |
| `Narrator: [text]` | `Doctor: [professional] [text]` |
| `[smiling]` | `[happy]` or `[cheerful]` (audible emotion) |

# V3 Technical Best Practices

## Prompt Length Requirement
- V3 is in ALPHA and needs longer inputs for stability
- Generate content of 250+ characters per entry when possible
- Don't make every entry super brief; allow for natural elaboration

## Use Natural Pauses
Add breathing room between major points:

```
Doctor: [professional] That completes the pre-surgery instructions. [pause] Let me now address some common concerns.
```

## Capitalization for Emphasis
```
Doctor: [serious] This is VERY important – do NOT rub your eye after surgery.
```

## Ellipses for Hesitation
```
Doctor: [thoughtful] I'm wondering… should we discuss the medication schedule next?
```
