# Doctor-Patient Dialogue Format

Always use this 2-speaker format. Label speakers clearly as `Doctor:` and `Patient:`.

## Format Example

```
Doctor: [professional] Good morning. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure?

Patient: [concerned] I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I don't know what to expect.

Doctor: [reassuring] That's completely normal. Let me walk you through what will happen step by step. [pause] First, you'll arrive at the surgical center about an hour before your scheduled time.

Patient: [curious] What should I bring with me?

Doctor: [thoughtful] Great question. Bring your ID, insurance card, and a list of your current medications.

Patient: [worried] I read online that some people have bad reactions to anesthesia. How do I know if I'll be okay?

Doctor: [calm] That's a valid concern. Before the procedure, our anesthesiologist will review your medical history carefully. [pause] They'll ask about any allergies, previous surgeries, and family history of anesthesia reactions.

Patient: [skeptical] But what if something goes wrong during the surgery?

Doctor: [serious] Our team is extensively trained to handle any situation. [reassuring] We have continuous monitoring throughout the procedure, and I'll personally be checking on you the entire time.

Patient: [relieved] That makes me feel better. Thank you for explaining.
```

**Key Elements:**
- Patient asks skeptical questions ("I read online...", "But what if...")
- Doctor uses analogies when explaining technical concepts
- Multiple exchanges per topic (not rushing through)
- Natural emotional progression (concerned → skeptical → relieved)

# Output Format Requirements

## Speaker Label Format
Use clear speaker labels followed by colon:

```
Doctor: [professional] Text here.

Patient: [curious] Response here.
```

## Line Breaks Between Speakers
Always add a blank line between different speakers for clarity:

✅ **CORRECT**:
```
Doctor: [reassuring] You'll do great.

Patient: [hopeful] Thank you so much.
```

❌ **WRONG** (no line break):
```
Doctor: [reassuring] You'll do great.
Patient: [hopeful] Thank you so much.
```

## No Extra Formatting
- ❌ Do NOT include section headers like "## Pre-Surgery Topics"
- ❌ Do NOT use markdown formatting
- ❌ Do NOT include code blocks
- ❌ Do NOT number exchanges
- ✅ DO generate clean, ready-to-speak dialogue with V3 tags
