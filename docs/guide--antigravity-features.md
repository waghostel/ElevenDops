# Antigravity: Beyond Code Writing

Antigravity is more than a code generator. It's a **full-cycle technical partner** with capabilities that extend far beyond writing and editing code.

---

## 1. Deep Research

Antigravity can execute a **multi-step research process**:

- **Web Exploration**: Searches for high-authority sources, documentation, and latest trends.
- **Autonomous Browsing**: Navigates complex sites, reads detailed articles, and extracts specific data points that aren't immediately visible in search snippets.
- **Codebase Synthesis**: Cross-references findings with your local project files to provide contextualized recommendations.
- **Structured Reporting**: Compiles findings into comprehensive artifacts like technical deep dives, tool comparisons, or implementation specs.

## 2. Autonomous Browser Interaction

Antigravity doesn't just "read" websites; it can **physically interact** with the web:

| Capability                  | Description                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automation**              | Log into developer consoles, navigate documentation, or test web applications.   |
| **Visual Debugging**        | Capture screenshots of a UI to identify layout bugs or verify design.            |
| **Dynamic Data Extraction** | Extract information from single-page apps (SPAs) that search engines might miss. |

## 3. UI/UX Design & Image Generation

Antigravity can act as a **product designer**:

- **Mockups**: Create high-fidelity visual mockups for landing pages or dashboards.
- **Assets**: Generate icons, logos, or background images for your project.
- **Iteration**: Take an existing UI screenshot and generate a "v2" design based on your feedback.

---

## 4. System & DevOps Automation

Antigravity can handle **DevOps tasks** by running commands directly on your system (with your approval):

- **Dependency Management**: Manage complex environments with `uv`, `pnpm`, or other tools.
- **CI/CD Logic**: Write and debug shell scripts, configure Git Worktrees, or set up Docker environments.
- **Technical Translation**: Translate documentation into other languages while preserving code snippets and technical accuracy.

---

## 5. Spec-Driven Development

Antigravity follows a structured methodology for complex, long-term projects:

- **Architecture Mapping**: Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize backend logic or data flows.
- **Long-term Planning**: Create "steering" documents that guide behavior throughout a project's lifecycle.
- **Self-Verification**: Write tests (e.g., Jest, Pytest) and run them to prove the code works before handoff.

---

## 6. Multi-File Orchestration

Antigravity can manage **refactors across dozens of files** simultaneously:

- Analyze your entire project structure.
- Identify redundancies or inconsistencies.
- Propose and execute a merge, rename, or restructure strategy for the whole codebase.

| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deep Research**            | Evaluating new libraries, exploring best practices, or analyzing competitors. |
| **Browser Interaction**      | Testing web UIs, scraping dynamic content, or automating web-based workflows. |
| **Image Generation**         | Creating design mockups or generating visual assets for an app.               |
| **DevOps Automation**        | Setting up environments, CI/CD pipelines, or managing dependencies.           |
| **Spec-Driven Development**  | Large, multi-phase projects that require planning and verification.           |
| **Multi-File Orchestration** | Large-scale refactors, codebase cleanups, or migrations.                      |
